"""
An example project in which three .wav files are played after eachother with a
break in between of a random note duration.
Used note durations are: sixteenth, eight, quarter notes

------ HANDS-ON TIPS ------
- Answer the following questions before running the code:
  - How many different samples will be played?
  - How many times a sample will be played?
  - How many seconds will there be in between the playback of samples? (3 answers)
  Check your answers by running the code.

- Alter the code:
  Write a function which returns a list with time intervals based on two
  arguments:
  - the bpm
  - a list of note durations
  Use this function.
